# Treasure-Island-TextGame
This text-based adventure game guides the player through a series of choices to find a hidden treasure on a mysterious island. Each decision leads to a different path, danger, or ending. This is a beginner-level project that uses user input, nested conditional statements, and basic control flow to build an interactive multi-step story.
